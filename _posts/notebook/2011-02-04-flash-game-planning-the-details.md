Before starting on the development I wanted to ensure that I knew all of the details about the game, so I began to jot down some notes.  

The basic notes I wrote were as follows:

- The user's car should be controlled by the arrow keys
- The user should have to race for the best time around the track
- The CPU should control a car that is designed just to get in the way.  The user has to avoid hitting this car in order to avoid point penalties being added onto the score at the end
- Each time the user hits the CPU, one point will be added.  Before being added to the final score this number will be timesd by five. 
- At the end of the game the user should get the opportunity to submit a high-score

With these basic principles of my game in place, I then began to produce the game.
