[Google Chromecast][chromecast] is a small device with plugs into a TV with HDMI support and allows you to 'cast' content from Google Chrome and some mobile devices. It's a well supported and cheap platform which I'm currently giving a talk on at [Plymouth JS][plymouth_js] for how to develop for it using the Chrome SDK.

To tie things together I thought it would be good to make the slides available and demo source code available. [The demo source code is on GitHub][github_repo], and the `readme` should contain everything needed to get started. Slides are below, and I've [hosted a copy of the demo app for playing with][demo].
