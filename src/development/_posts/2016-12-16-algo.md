Over the last few months there’s been a bit of a race to arms with many folk arming themselves with a VPN for protection against Snoopers Charter – formally known as the [Digital Economy Bill](https://services.parliament.uk/bills/2016-17/digitaleconomy.html "Digital Economy Bill 2016-17") – amongst other reasons. For me personally, it’s as much a means of protecting myself on public WiFi from snooping third parties and compromised devices as I complete tasks with arguably more sensitive information online in public spaces.

I’ve spent some trying to get [StrongSwan](http://strongswan.org "StrongSwan VPN") working one the last week, but [Nick](https://nickcharlton.net "Nick Charlton") sent me a link to [Algo](http://github.com/trailofbits/algo "Algo -- a VPN in minutes") yesterday. Within a few minutes of starting out with it I have a fully configured [Digital Ocean instance](https://m.do.co/c/d0820e126448 "Digital Ocean Cloud VPS Hosting") (yes – that's a referral link – but you get $10 to) running everything I require for my VPN, as well as a `.mobileconfig` file to install on my Mac OS and iOS computers and devices.

It was painless enough to work with I’m not going to say anything more on the topic past this — if you’re after a VPN, give it a go. It may well save you a lot of time.
