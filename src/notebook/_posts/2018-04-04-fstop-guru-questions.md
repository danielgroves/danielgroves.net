It was in May last year that I published [my review of the F-Stop Guru UL adventure camera pack][review]. I'd been using it to shoot for about 6 months, covering how I use it in partnership with some of my [Peak][pd1] [Design][pd2] [gear][gear]. 

Over the last 9 months or so I've receievd a heap of questions on the pack, so I've picked a few of the more common ones to answer here. 

## 1. Do you use the backpack on your bike, or do you place the gear _on_ your bike?

In short: it depends.

There's there a couple of factors I considor when decided how to carry a camera on the bike. The biggest factor in this decidion is if I'm predominantly on-road, or off-road. If I'm mostly riding off-road I'll be running my bikepacking setup like that featured in _[Gearless][]_, which has no space for equipment like my camera. In that scenario I'll be using the F-Stop pack, with the weather-cover fitted, and keeping it as light as possible to maintain maxiumum comfort. 

If I'm doing a long-distance road-tour [such as Eurovelo][eurovelo] I will be loading the camera onto the bike. In this scenario I have a Ortlieb bar-pack with a ICU designed for small mirrorless cameras. This worked well for my 4000+km tour across Europe, but would be usless for anything bigger than my Fuji. 

## 2. Should I ge the Guru or the Mindshift/Think Tanq/some other equivalent?

In short: I don't know. 

I've not really tied _that many_ camera packs, and probably haven’t tried the specific one that you're asking about. However, [feel free to get in contact][contact] and check, I'm always happy to help. 

If you work for any camera-pack companies and can arrange for any trail packs, [then please let me know][contact]. I'd love to try your pack out!

## 3. I'm short/tall/average, will the Guru fit? 

In short: probably.

I'm 6' 4", or 193cm. It fits me fine, and has loads of adjsutment so it will fit people significantly shorter, or a little taller, fairly well. The bag comes in at 48.5cm tall, so take a measurement from your wasit to your shoulder, and as long as you're a little longer than that you should be fine. 

## 4. I'm skinnier/wider than average, will the Guru fit? 

In short: yep. 

I'm a 30"/76cm waist and I could shorten the waist-band loads yet, and I'm probably going to trim it on mine at some point because it's way too long for me! Fully extended the wasit bad has a circumference of 133cm. 

## 5. Is it really worth the money? 

In short: for me, yes. 

I won't delve into the details of my choice, [I already covered that in my original article][review]. 

## 6. Will my kit fit?

In short: it depends what you have! 

The small-shallow ICU is perfect for me to fit:

* Filters
* Three lenses (23mm F2, 12mm F2, 18-55 F2.8)
* X-T1 Body
* Camera straps
* Spare SD Cards
* 4x Batteries
* Remote shutter cable
* Cleaning kit

It's taken some careful organisation to get all that in, and I rarely actually use my Medium-Shallow ICU right now. 

The Medium-Shallow ICU is deeper than the Small-Shallow. The Small will take the X-T1 body perfectly, while the Medium gets the same fit when the battery grip is fitted — that's not to say it's too big without the grip — it's not, it's fine. I'd avoid fitting the grip with the Small ICU, though.

Alongside everything I would normally take in the Small ICU, I could probably drop a 50-140 and something like a 16-55 into the Medium ICU, with some careful packing.

## 7. Where did you get your's from?

In short: F-Stop directly

At the time you could specify for your order from come from the EU warehouse and pay in Euros. I did this, but it doens't look like they do this anymore. 

## 8. How's it holding up now?

In short: fine

I managed to poke a small hole in one piece of mesh, and it's looks a lot more used, but it still looks tidy and every bit as good on day one. 

## 9. Any regrets?

In short: I should have orderded a pair of [Gatekeepers][], a [raincover][], and maybe a [ICU Gate][gate]. 

I've been using an [Osprey rain cover][osprey_raincover] on mine, it doens't fit half as well as their own appears to, but you'd expect that given the [official one][raincover] is designed for the pack speciifically. I should've got a pair of [gate-keeper straps][Gatekeeper] too, so I could strap a sleeping-bag to the outside on the odd occasion I wish to. Finally the [ICU Gate][gate] would be pretty handy to keep things like batteies wheere I want them. 

## 10. Would you buy it again if it broke tomorrow?

In short: yes!

I'd quite like a [Loko UL][loko] to go alongside it, though. 

## And that's it!

That's probably the 10 most common questions I've heard over the last nine months, if you'd like to ask something specific, or jsut want to say _Hi!_ feel free [to drop me an email][contact] and I'll get back to you, or grab me on any of the social networks below.
