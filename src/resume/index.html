    <h3>Interests/Activities</h3>

    <p>I believe that it's important to maintain a healthy work-life balance, and as a result of this I've developed many hobbies away from the screen. I take my photography seriously and you will find evidence of this littered across my website which follows the expeditions I partake in on my own time. This led me to Cycle across Europe in the summer of 2016, and to complete a series of smaller 'microadventures'.</p>

    <p>I spend a lot of time on my road and mountain bikes, during the evenings and weekends, as well as rock climbing regularly, walking and backpacking. When I'm less active you can usually find me listening to music, reading books, watching films or writing about adventures while editing photos. </p>
