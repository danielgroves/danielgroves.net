    <h3>Skills</h3>

    <p>As a developer I like to keep work agile. I use Git for version control, making it easy to collaborate with large teams of other developers. I can write unit tests for applications, which allows for easy automated testing of software to ensure that changes in the future to not break the application. When developing larger application I prefer to use a web framework, as this provides the scaffolding for the project and saves on development time by not reinventing the wheel.</p>

    <p>When designing I work directly in the browser. This allows designs to be developed quickly whilst showing the full dimensions of a design from desktop all the way through to mobile, something missed by graphical representations. In the past I have worked in Adobe Fireworks and Photoshop to produce site mockups and Adobe Dreamweaver to produce finished products, although I prefer to hand-code sites as it provides more flexibility and more options for incorporating new technologies.</p>

    <p><strong>Languages:</strong> Python, Ruby, Java, PHP, Bash Shell Script, C#, HTML, CSS, jQuery, ActionScript</p>
    <p><strong>Frameworks:</strong> Django, Django RESTful Framework, ASP.net</p>

    <h3>Interests/Activities</h3>
    <p>I have a large range of activities that I partake in on a regular basis. I have previously been the representative for the University of Plymouth Cycling Club, where I organised weekly rides or varying length and difficulty, often out onto Dartmoor. I am also an active climber and spend a lot of time at High Sports climbing centre. I am a frequent visitor to areas such as the Lake District and the Scottish Highlands where I partake in activities such as backpacking, hiking and camping.</p>
    <p>Wherever I am it is common to see me out with my D-SLR, I am a huge fan of photography, using it as a lone hobby when doing shots such as landscapes or combined with other hobbies, for example I often take my camera mountain biking.</p>
    <p>On top of this I am constantly on-line developing my presence through web design. Other hobbies include reading, listening to music and watching DVDs. I was a member of the Air Training Corps for four years.</p>
