# danielgroves.net Source

This is the source code for my personal website, [danielgroves.net][]

## Usage

Setting up and using the site is pretty easy. Make sure you have Ruby installed, and the bundler gem, then install the required gems.

```bash
gem install bundler
bundle install
```

Then run using rake : `bundle exec rake dev:watch`

Then simply go to [localhost:4000][localhost] in your browser.

### Rake Tasks

Other rake tasks are:
* `version` - Jekyll version number.
* `dev:watch` - Start the Jekyll server in watch mode with future and draft posts. Loads the `_config_dev.yml` file to override production values with development values.
* `dev:build` - Builds the site with the default options. Loads the `_config_dev.yml` file to override production values with development values.
* `deploy` - Do a production build.
* `typekit:add_domain` - Adds a domain to a typekit kit whitelist based on your environment.
* `typekit:remove_domain` - Removes a domain from a typekit kit whitelist based on your environment.
* `assets:precompile` - Default task called by the build pipeline. See below for details.

#### Typekit Tasks

The Rake tasks in the `typekit` namespace are used by Heroku as [postdeploy][heroku_postdeploy] and [pr-predestroy][heroku_predestroy] scripts. This allows Heroku to automatically add and remove [Review App][heroku_review] domains from the Typekit kit whitelist. This is achieved by calling into the Typekit API to add and remove the domains. Three environmental variables are required:

* `TYPEKIT_API_AUTH` - This should be a valid [Typekit API Key][typekit_api_key].
* `TYPEKIT_KIT_ID` - The ID of the kit you want to update (this is supplied on the settings page for the kit).
* `HEROKU_APP_NAME` - This is automatically supplied by Heroku, and is used to build the app domain.

When these three variables are present the Rake tasks can be invoked.

### Deployment

Deployment is completely automated, and happens via a [Heroku pipeline][heroku_pipeline]. Anything that goes to the `master` branch is automatically deployed to staging. I use [Heroku Review Apps][heroku_review] to automatically stage branches to help with gaining feedback from friends, family, and colleagues.

The [Heroku Ruby Buildpack][heroku_buildpack] automatically runs the Rake task `assets:precompile`, so to minimise my personal technical debt I utilise this default behaviour to build the site.
